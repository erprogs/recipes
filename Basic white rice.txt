Ingredients:
    1 cup long grain rice
    2 cups water
    1 teaspoon salt
    1 teaspoon butter (optional)
    
Directions

    In a saucepan with a good fitting lid bring water, salt and butter if desired to a boil.
    Add rice and stir.
    Cover and reduce heat to medium low. You will know that your temperature is correct if a little steam is visible leaking from the lid. A lot of steam means your heat is too high.
    Cook for 20 minutes.
    DO NOT LIFT LID!
    The steam that is trapped inside the pan is what allows the rice to cook properly.
    Remove from heat and fluff with fork.
    Serve!
